# RBC GEN Setup Guide

Wrote this because yall was tryna charge me for account gens. There might be some bugs here and there because I wrote this and tested it just once, but DM me if any of you guys are facing issues and I'll fix it. Didn't manage and can't test this extensively because I just realized that my Gmails are not forwarding!!! README generated by ChatGPT

### Latest Update

- added proxy support
- improved imap handling (for reading of email OTP codes)
- there's a possibility that the fingerprint affects the emails being sent out to the inbox? Trying to figure out why I'm not getting all the OTP codes

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following files in the `data` directory:

- `registered.txt`
- `unregistered.txt`

### Configuration Steps

1. **Email Setup**: The generator uses an email to receive OTPs necessary for the generation process. To set this up, edit the file `cmd/main.go` on line 39 to insert your Gmail email address and the app-specific password generated from your Google account. Replace the existing credentials with your own:

   ```go
   if err := imapClient.Login("yourEmail@gmail.com", "yourAppSpecificPassword"); err != nil {
       log.Fatalf("error logging into IMAP client: %s", err)
   }
   ```

   Ensure your email address and password are enclosed within the double quotes.

2. **Concurrency Settings**: The number of concurrent tasks that the generator can run is adjustable. To change this, edit the `cmd/main.go` file on line 57:

   ```go
   sem := semaphore.NewWeighted(N) // Replace N with the desired number of concurrent tasks
   ```

   Replace `N` with the number of tasks you wish to run at the same time.

3. **Inbox Reading Cap**: You may also want to adjust how many email messages the generator reads from the inbox concurrently. To do this, modify line 585 in the `gen/api.go` file:

   ```go
   emails, err := imap.GetMailRange(client, M) // Replace M with the desired number of email messages
   ```

   Where `M` is the number of emails to read. Adjust this number based on your expected volume.

### Running the Account Gen

Once you have configured the settings as described above, you can run the script using the following command in your terminal:

```sh
go run ./cmd
```

Ensure you have Go installed on your system and that your working directory is the root of the RBC GEN project.
